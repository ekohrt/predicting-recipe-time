In the examples above, a recipe for Eggs Bennedict is provided, from a website not included in the original dataset, and the model predicts a total time of 38.9 minutes - close to the actual time of 35 minutes. Providing a 150 minute recipe for homemade bread, the model predicts 156.0 mintues. \n","  \n","The best model we trained was the **Gradient-Boosting Regressor**, which achieved an R<sup>2</sup> score of **0.767**. As expected, the ensemble methods performed better than the individual models, even with less parameter tuning (due to prohibitively long compute times). While not perfect, such a model could be useful on a site like AllRecipes.com, where lots of user-submitted recipes of varying quality are processed every day."],"metadata":{"id":"S-YMeoBSnttu"}}]}
